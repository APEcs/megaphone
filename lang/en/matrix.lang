MATRIX_HELP_TITLE    = Help
MATRIX_HELP          = This table allows you to view the potential message recipients, and the systems through which you may contact them. Click on a recipient name in the left column of the table to toggle on or off all the potential methods to contact that recipient. Alternatively, you may selectively turn on or off contact methods for each recipient via the checkboxes in the table.
MATRIX_HELP_ACTIVE   = If a cell in the table contains a checkbox, you have the option to contact the recipient via the system the column corresponds to.
MATRIX_HELP_INACTIVE = If a cell in the table contains <img src="templates/default/images/delete.png" width="16" height="16" alt="inactive" title="{L_MESSAGE_NOTARGET}" />, you can not contact the recipient using this system.
MATRIX_HELP_FOLDING  = Some rows in the table have a 'tree folding' icon at the left side of the recipient cell (<img src="templates/default/images/blockclose.png" width="11" height="11" alt="toggle" /> or <img src="templates/default/images/blockopen.png" width="11" height="11" alt="toggle" />). Clicking on this icon allows you to show or hide groups of recipients. If you can't see a recipient in the table that you expect to be there, make sure that you have unfolded all the rows in the table and checked that it hasn't been hidden.
